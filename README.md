# App-development
An application for task manager is created.
Implement a command-line (CLI) program that lets you manage your todos.
1. The app can be run in the console with `./todo`.

2. The app reads from and write to a `todo.txt` text file. Each todo item occupies a single line in this file. Here is an example file that has 2 todo items.

```txt
water the plants
change light bulb
```

3.  When a todo item is completed, it is removed from `todo.txt` and instead added to the `done.txt` text file. This file has a different format:

    ```txt
    x 2020-06-12 the text contents of the todo item
    ```

    1. the letter x
    2. the current date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format
    3. the original text

    The date when the todo is marked as completed is recorded in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format (ISO 8601). For example, a date like `15th August, 2020` is represented as `2020-08-15`.
